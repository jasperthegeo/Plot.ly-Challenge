# Plot.ly-Challenge

This plotly challenged looked at processing a large json file and outputting several graphs; a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart and a gauge as a bonus which was not attempted. 

The repository includes; index.html, app.js, data.json along with a css file. 
The js.app contains 5 functions, an initalisation function, 2x graphing functions, 1 x metadata function, and an on-change/drop down menu function. I dediced to use as much seperation to the function as possible to minimise the risk of bugs, and to make debugging simpler.
